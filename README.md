# BusinessReqsAndSystemDesign ReadMe

# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client for this project, DriverPass wanted to bring online and in-person driver education classes to students wanting additional practice prior to taking the written and road tests at the DMV.  This client wanted a web-based application with cross-platform compatibility, including mobile devices.  They also wanted the application to be based in the cloud to minimize technical issues.  Having the application in the cloud also provided a secure interface as well as a means to backup the system.

# What did you do particularly well?
I think I did a reasonably good job paying attention to the client's requests and capturing their requirements in the Business Requirements Document.  I spent a lot of time trying to add as much detail as I could to the client's basic requirements.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would like to spend more time working on my UML class diagram.  Although we were only required to list attributes for the different objects and not any methods, I think it would be valuable to spend some more time thinking about this diagram and making sure all the needed objects and attributes are captured.  I would also like to go back and add some methods after thinking about the methods that would be required from a programmer's perspective.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I spent a lot of time reading and taking notes on the provided documentation on the user's requirements and trying to make sure I understood their requests clearly.  The documentation provided gave a good layout of the desired look of the interface as well as the different components that would be needed.  I interpreted the user's needs by making a list of their requirements and then added the needed detail to each item of the list.  I incorporated these details into the design by taking each list item with its corresponding detail and turning it into a step-by-step process.  I think it's important to consider the user's needs when designing because thes requirements will guide the design to make sure that the user's requirements are met.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I think the big takeaway for me for this course was to really focus on breaking a system down into discrete objects and then assigning objects with attributes and methods.  It was really helpful throughout this course to keep revisiting the client's requirements to make sure the design was evolving as it should.  I think that listing out the requirements in a way that could be translated into object-oriented programming will be particularly useful for future software designing projects.
